# cerp

## Overview

The CRA Center for Evaluating the Research Pipeline (CERP) collects large amounts of survey data. The cerp package makes it easy to clean, manipulate, and transform CERP data. All functions in the cerp package are documented, and most contain self-contained examples of how to apply each function.

## How to install

1. First, you need to install the `devtools` package (if you have never used it) using the `install.packages()` command.
2. Load the devtools package. `library(devtools)`
3. Use devtools' `install_github()` function to install the package: `install_github(repo = "cra-cerp/cerp", build_vignettes = TRUE)`
4. Load the package `library(cerp)`
5. To view the package vignette, use `vignette(topic = "Introduction to cerp", 
package = "cerp")` 

## Getting Help

If you notice a bug or you have trouble using a function, please contact Dr. Ama Nyame-Mensah [ama@cra.org](mailto:ama@cra.org), the maintainer of the cerp package.
